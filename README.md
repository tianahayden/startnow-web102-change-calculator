The Change Calculator project is designed to help you give the right change to your customer. First, input the total value of goods sold in the "Total Cost of Goods" field. This is the amount of money that the customer owes the store.
Next, input the amount of money that the customer gave you to pay for their items. Input this value in the "Amount Given By Customer" field.

Once you hit "Submit", the site will show the exact change needed to give back to the customer. It will show the exact number of dollar bills and coins to return. A robot could now give the correct amount of change and your job as a cashier is redundant. You're welcome!
